Gadgeto! is a collection of tools that aim to facilitate the development of
REST APIs in Go.
These tools are based on and enrich popular open-source solutions, to provide
higher-level functionalities.

Components:
    - Tonic: Based on the REST framework Gin (https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin),
                tonic lets you write simpler handler functions, and handles
                repetitive tasks for you (parameter binding, error handling).

    - Zesty: Based on Gorp (https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp), zesty abstracts
                DB specifics for easy (nested) transaction management.

** PARAMS **
flatten input type from wosk :
Order:
-pass path params first
-query params second (alphasort)
-body last (alphasort)
Param names: 
-take from json/wosk.
Resiliency to changes:
-if body params names change => api broken
-if path param change name but type stays the same, api is unchanged => to protect SDK we pass them first respection uri order
-if someone adds an optional param, sdk will be broken


** FUNCTION NAMES **
we don't have restful apis, so it's hard to make up meaningful names
-> we currently use handler name but:
	-it's subject to change
	-a merger service with different packages containing handler may provoke collisions
-> we could use some comments but's it's not super solid either

but.... we could use this during version releasing and load previous version 
  => sdk generator could ask confirmation "sdk method for POST /foobar name will change from CreateBaz to NewBaz"
